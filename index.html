    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>In 2000, after Jharkhand separated from Bihar, realization struck that schools which were established to provide a firm ground to meritorious students like the Indira Gandhi Residential School, Hazaribagh for girls, and Bihar's pride the Netarhat
        Residential School had both gone to Jharkhand. Since that time, an urgent need was felt to establish schools that would eliminate the vacuum created by their loss. On 12 August 2009 some alumni of Netarhat, on the initiative and invitation of
        the Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, came forward to help the state government by adopting roles suitable for them on the basis of their experience at Netarhat. Taking into consideration the need for the present circumstances it was accepted
        by general consensus that the medium of instruction would be English. On the suggestion of Chief Minister Kumar in the meeting, it was also decided that only one school would be opened that would be co-educational and would provide a common platform
        to both meritorious boys and girls to garner quality education under the guidance of qualified and experienced teachers chosen from all over the country. Under the guidance of the State Government's Human Resource Department's Principal Secretary
        Anjani Kumar Singh, the department set the wheels in motion in a record time of less than a year. The first batch of 120 students reached Simultala on 6/7 August 2010 and on 9 August 2010, Minister Kumar officially inaugurated Simultala Awasiya
        Vidyalaya.

        and other official holidays) in one year and 100 days of vacation. In one academic session, there will be two semesters and one final examination. Holidays would be declared thrice in each session namely summer vacations (60 days) and Festival
        Break(40 days). Each semester's results would be worth 50 marks i.e., 10 marks each for 2 formative assessment results and 30 marks for Summative Assessment. For the results of the examinations held at the end of each session, 30% weightage would
